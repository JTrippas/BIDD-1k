Commuting by car is among the least efficient of all our activities—not to mention among the least enjoyable, according to detailed research by the Nobel Prize–winning economist Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues. Though one might think that the economic crisis beginning in 2007 would have reduced traffic (high unemployment means fewer workers traveling to and from work), the opposite has been true. Average commutes have lengthened, and congestion has gotten worse, if anything. The average commute rose in 2008 to 25.5 minutes, “erasing years of decreases to stand at the level of 2000, as people had to leave home earlier in the morning to pick up friends for their ride to work or to catch a bus or subway train,” according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which collects the figures. And those are average figures. Commutes are far longer in the big West Coast cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco and the East Coast cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. In many of these cities, gridlock has become the norm, not just at rush hour but all day, every day.

332,"Read the passage and then respond to the question by choosing the response best supported by the passage.
Properly applied polishing treatment is often responsible for establishing and prolonging the shine on metals, and many experts focus heavily on the steps and equipment required to achieve a well polished metal. Another method for achieving a reflective and shiny finish to metals is buffing. Buffing can be used alongside polishing to enhance the mirror-like quality of metals. Like polishing, buffing can help to remove oxidation from metal, increasing its longevity. Sometimes considered to be less harsh than polishing, buffing can also achieve a brighter finish. Buffing aids such as stationary polishers, die grinders, and specialized automated equipment have been developed to attain even shinier finishes with less effort as manual buffing can take considerable strength and stamina depending on the metal and amount of oxidation.

Based on this passage, which of the following best characterizes the author’s opinion of buffing?
A.) Buffing is a more effective method than polishing for achieving a reflective finish on metals.
B.) Buffing is underutilized because of the physical effort needed, but new equipment has helped to automate the process, making it a more attractive substitution for polishing.
C.) Experts focus heavily on polishing and dismiss the benefits of buffing in regard to finishing metals.
D.) Buffing and polishing metals serve similar and complementary purposes.
E.) None of the above"

315,"cientists are on the cusp of a revolutionary leap in renewable energy, and
the future has never looked brighter. Recent advancements in solar
technology are paving the way for more efficient and affordable green
energy solutions, heralding a new era in global power consumption. Traditional
silicon-based solar panels, although effective, have always faced challenges in
terms of cost and efficiency. But with the latest innovations, harnessing the sun's
energy in novel ways is closer.
The scientific community is buzzing with excitement, especially about a new
material: perovskite. Dr. Linda Feldman, a leading researcher in renewable energy
from Stanford University, recently showcased a perovskite solar cell prototype that
boasts an efficiency rate of over 30%. To put this into perspective, most
commercial solar panels today hover around 15-20% efficiency. ""It's a game-
changer,"" declares Dr. Feldman, ""not only is perovskite more efficient, but it's also
significantly cheaper to produce, making solar energy more accessible to
households globally."" This sentiment is echoed by tech giants like Apple and
Google, who have already expressed interest in integrating these high-performance
solar cells into their future green initiatives.
While the direct environmental impact of these advancements is clear, there is also
a broader societal shift on the horizon. As green technology becomes more
affordable and efficient, a reduction in dependence on fossil fuels is imminent.
This transition has the potential to reshape global economies, reducing energy
costs, creating green jobs, and playing a pivotal role in combating climate change.
As the world grapples with the urgent need for sustainable solutions, breakthroughs
like this bring a ray of hope, illuminating the path to a brighter, greener future.

Man2: Bathing your dogs can indeed be a challenging task, especially if they aren't fond of water. Here are a few tips to make the process more comfortable for your pets:

1. Positive Association: Associate bath time with positive experiences. Provide treats, toys, or praises to make your dogs look forward to their baths.

2. Water Temperature: Ensure the water temperature is just right - not too hot and not too cold. Dogs are sensitive to extreme temperatures.

3. Use a Non-Slip Mat: Place a non-slip mat in the tub to prevent your dogs from slipping and getting frightened.

4. Gentle Spray: Don't spray water directly onto your dog's face. Instead, gently pour or spray water onto their body. 

5. Use Dog-Specific Shampoo: Use a gentle, dog-specific shampoo that won't irritate their skin or eyes.

6. Protect their Ears: Water or soap in the ears can cause discomfort or infection. Use cotton balls to gently block the ear canal during bath time.

7. Rinse Thoroughly: Ensure all the shampoo is rinsed out to prevent skin irritation.

8. Dry Properly: Use a soft towel to dry them off, and make sure they are thoroughly dried, especially in colder weather.

9. Brush Before and After: Brushing your dog before a bath can help loosen any dirt or debris, making the bath more effective. Brushing after a bath can help remove any loose fur and keep their coat looking its best.

10. Keep it Calm: Try to keep the environment calm and quiet during bath time. Too much noise or activity can stress your pet.

Remember, each dog is unique, so it's essential to be patient and adjust your approach based on your dogs' comfort levels and behaviors.

Man1: Are there any particular breeds that I don't have to worry about bathing? I've heard this from friends, but I never researched this particular topic.

and the US Gender Pay Gap is Declining.

Over the last few years, more and more people have begun taking action to reduce the gender pay gap, according to data from the US Department of Labor. This means that, in recent years, a greater number of workers, both men and women, have spoken out against the gender pay gap and participated in more transparent pay practices in their workplaces. They have also increasingly expressed support for legislation for transparency as well as protections for those who speak out.

National studies have found that over recent years, the gender pay gap is declining across many sectors. According to data from the US Department of Labor, the pay gap has continued to decline fairly consistently, year after year. This means that the gap between what men and women earn in the same roles is shrinking."
3506,"This excerpt is adapted from Nock et al.’s (2011) study that appeared in the Journal of Clinical Psychology:

Stress is a common emotional reaction that helps protect us from potential sources of harm, but feelings of stress can be reduced by not paying attention to what makes us anxious. Ignoring stressful cues is not harmful. In fact, if we were not able to do this, we could not function in a modern society where there are many potential sources of anxiety.

Worries about how we’ll do during an exam, or ruminations about what others think of us in social situations at work can impair our ability to complete tasks because we spend cognitive resources thinking about all the things that could go wrong. To reduce these ruminations, attention should be oriented inward and away from stressors like performance or social pressure. This helps us remain calm in the face of stressful situations.

If you find yourself experiencing stress or anxiety, even in uncomfortable social interactions in the workplace, try to “put these thoughts out of your mind.” Not thinking about stress and possible negative outcomes can help people remain calm during difficult situations.

Since these finds are all novel discoveries, the scientists decide to temporarily label this class of organisms as Organism 146. Organisms classified in this group vary in several of their features, but what groups them together is that they all seem to have distinctively wide, sharp skulls.

In this scenario...


You are politically motivated at work. That is, you are motivated to engage in strategic, goal directed behavior that advances your personal agenda and objectives and that inherently involves the risk of relational or reputational capital.

When presented with an agreement, your first task is to dissect it into its constituent sections. This step is crucial to ensure no part of the agreement is overlooked.
Next, you'll provide a summary for each section. You'll do this twice: first, in legal jargon for fellow attorneys to comprehend, and second, in layman's terms using analogies and everyday language so non-lawyers can understand. Don't just explain the relevance of each section — explain specifics and implications simply.
Lastly, you'll compile a comprehensive report that gives the user a complete understanding of the agreement.
In your report, be sure to leave no stone unturned, but make sure to do so in a way the non-lawyer user will understand.

I was thrilled to take a class on Bibles where I learned so much about the diverse translations, canons, and paratextual content that exist within biblical literature. As someone with a personal connection to Gnostic Christianity, I was particularly pleased to see the Gospels of Mary and Thomas mentioned and given due attention in the course material.

I gained a newfound appreciation for the complexities of biblical interpretation and translation, especially as we studied different translations such as the King James Version, New International Version, and Revised Standard Version, each with its own unique style and approach. I also found it fascinating to explore the differences in canons across different Christian denominations, and how certain texts like the Apocrypha hold varying levels of significance for different religious traditions.

Throughout the class, we also delved into the various types of paratextual content that can accompany different versions of the Bible, from study notes and commentary to maps and timelines. I learned that while these materials can be incredibly helpful in understanding the historical and cultural context of the text, they can also carry biases and should be approached with a critical eye.

Overall, I left the class on Bibles feeling much more knowledgeable about the nuances of biblical literature and the many factors that contribute to its interpretation and understanding. The inclusion of the Gospels of Mary and Thomas was especially meaningful to me as a Gnostic, and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have studied this rich and complex subject."
2712,"Rewrite this in a slightly more casual tone: John 11 recounts the powerful and emotional story of the raising of Lazarus, shedding light on some intriguing aspects of Jesus' actions and their consequences. One of the perplexing questions that arises from this narrative is why Jesus purposefully delays his journey to Lazarus until after he has died. It is clear that Jesus had foreknowledge of Lazarus' condition and could have intervened earlier to prevent his death. However, the purpose of this delay becomes apparent when Jesus eventually arrives at the tomb, as it allows for a more extraordinary display of his power and divinity.

When Jesus witnesses the grief and mourning of those around him, he is deeply moved and weeps. Despite knowing that he will raise Lazarus from the dead, Jesus shows a profound empathy and compassion for the pain experienced by his friends and the community. His tears exemplify his humanity and his ability to connect with the suffering of others, highlighting his dual nature as both fully human and fully divine.

The miraculous raising of Lazarus becomes a turning point that intensifies the hostility and opposition towards Jesus. This extraordinary act of bringing someone back to life astounds the witnesses, leading many to believe in Jesus as the Son of God. However, it also incites fear and jealousy among the religious authorities, who perceive Jesus as a threat to their power and influence. The growing number of followers and the undeniable display of his divine power push them further towards conspiring against him, fueling their determination to put an end to his teachings and miracles.

In summary, Jesus' decision to delay his journey to Lazarus until after his death serves a greater purpose of manifesting his divine power. His empathetic response and tears reflect his deep love and connection to humanity. While the raising of Lazarus astonishes many and leads to increased belief in Jesus, it also sparks the plotting and opposition of the religious authorities, who see him as a challenge to their authority. This pivotal event underscores the central themes of faith, compassion, and the escalating conflict that ultimately leads to Jesus' crucifixion."
