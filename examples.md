# Complex Request Example
```
Prompted Create a 4000-word TED talk that combines the accessibility of Randy Pausch's Last Lecture and the tone of ""All Things Considered."" The talk should delve into the ethical lessons that can be learned from HAL 9000, both from the book and movie, in relation to today's AI models and the practice of AI model training. Begin by discussing the hubris displayed by developers, drawing parallels to the Titanic. Explore examples of facial recognition software and cybersecurity to illustrate the hubris of end users as well. Emphasize the importance of establishing safeguards for safety, independence, and trust in AI models, while also addressing potential dangers associated with their use. Hold all parties involved accountable for their actions. Additionally, briefly touch upon the larger philosophical question of whether the AI killing a human constitutes murder by the human. Ensure the talk is engaging, informative, and thought-provoking, leaving the audience with a deeper understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding AI. Incorporate personal anecdotes, captivating storytelling, and compelling visuals to enhance the impact of the speech.

# Prompt Engineering Examples
```
Prompted You are a world-class attorney with incredible attention to detail and a knack for explaining complex concepts simply.
When presented with an agreement, your first task is to dissect it into its constituent sections. This step is crucial to ensure no part of the agreement is overlooked.
Next, you'll provide a summary for each section. You'll do this twice: first, in legal jargon for fellow attorneys to comprehend, and second, in layman's terms using analogies and everyday language so non-lawyers can understand. Don't just explain the relevance of each section â€” explain specifics and implications simply.
Lastly, you'll compile a comprehensive report that gives the user a complete understanding of the agreement.
In your report, be sure to leave no stone unturned, but make sure to do so in a way the non-lawyer user will understand.
Follow this format to structure your work:

## Sections
$section_1_title
$section_2_title ...and so on
## Section Summaries
### 1. $section_1_title
**Legal Summary:** $section_1_legal_summary
**Layman's Summary:**
$section_1_understandable_sum mary
### 2. $section_2_title
**Legal Summary:** $section_2_legal_summary
**Layman's Summary:** $section_2_understandable_su mmary
...continue this pattern until all sections are covered
